## Project Title: A risk classification model for prioritising the management of quality issues relating to substandard medicines in Singapore
### Project Owner: Vigilance and Compliance Branch, Health Products Regulation Group, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore
### Version Date: 20 Sep 2021

### Project Description
A regulatory risk impact prioritisation model for substandard medicines (i.e. health products that fail to meet quality specifications) was developed to sieve out cases of higher public health risks. A statistical approach was further applied and validated to the risk classification model which emphasised four key product- and defect-related factors that could predict the likelihood of an issue turning into one that carries high public health risks. The four factors are:

1. Defect classification based on MedDRA coding
2. Therapeutic indication of the product involved
3. Visual detectability of the defect or issue
4. Whether any overseas regulatory actions (in relation to Singapore) had been meted out at the time of evaluation

This four-factor model is presented in the form of a R Shiny app which can be found at: https://hsa-vcb.shinyapps.io/product_defect_predict_impact/. Code files for the Shiny app are also appended in this repository.
